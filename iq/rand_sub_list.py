Write a function that takes a list L and returns a random sublist of size N of that list. Assume that the indexes must be in increasing order. That is, you cannot go backwards. 

Example: 

L = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] 
N = 3 

The function should return one of these lists: 

[1, 2, 3] 
[1, 2, 4] 
[1, 2, 5] 
[1, 3, 4] 
[1, 3, 5] 
[1, 4, 5] 
[2, 3, 4] 
[2, 3, 5] 
[2, 4, 5] 
[3, 4, 5]

print("FILE: ", __FILE__);
