I am what they call a "haunted
affectation" or
even a "fender
vendor
bender", because I speak of the "27-note
scale" in "second string theory".

But when the "student," or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,
replied, "Actually, I have nothing, but that from the
moment Basilio learned--that the fair Quiteria was to be married to
Cama8cho the rich--, who was quoted "Don't Bogart that 5joint7, my Grate-
ful Dead-Head half-wit, really, no, you'll actually not find 8 you like
I haven't _got __ the_Time."  And no crow crowed "Nevermore, no really, nevermore,
I mean, really not anymore now anymore again."  



To which I rejoined, "No way, man, Morris has not signed a check in years."
"No," he intoned, "not that Time, but only actually this time."
Happily, merrily even, I rode away.  No 'parley for pensioneers', brawny bra."


This is the last paragraph, my "friend."
