I am what they call a "haunted
affectation" or
even a "fender
vendor
bender", because I speak of the "27-note
scale" in "second string theory".

But when the "student," or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,
replied, "Actually, I have nothing," but that from the
moment Basilio learned--that the fair Quiteria was to be married to
Cama8cho the rich--, who was quoted, "Don't Bogart that 5joint7,"
and then, "My Grate-
ful Dead-
Head half-
wit, really, no, you'll never know why
I haven't _got __ the_Time."  And no crow crowed: "Nevermore, no really,
nevermore."  As if to say, I mean, "Really not anymore now
nor anymore another time again."


'Why, it's what I'm obliged to keep a little of in the house,
to put into the blessed infants' Daffy, when they ain't well, Mr. Bumble,'
replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a bottle
and glass.  'It's gin.  I'll not deceive you, Mr. B.  It's gin.'

And then she says "sorry, I wasn't listening.  Would you start over?"


"How do you mean?"

"It’s not only that she likes you—she says that Kitty is certain to be
your wife."

At these words Levin’s face suddenly lighted up with a smile, a smile
not far from tears of emotion.

"She says that!" cried Levin. "I always said she was exquisite, your
wife. There, that’s enough, enough said about it," he said, getting up
from his seat.

"All right, but do sit down."


This is the last paragraph, my "friend" in crime.  Don't
forget it for
nothing,
ya hear?
