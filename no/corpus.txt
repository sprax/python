I am what they call a "haunted
affectation" or
even a "fender

bender", because I speak of the "27-note
scale" in "second string theory".

But when the "student," or, as Don Quixote called him, licentiate,
replied, "Actually, I have nothing," but that from the
moment Basilio learned--that the fair Quiteria was to be married to
Cama8cho the rich--, who was quoted, "Don't Bogart that 5joint7,"
and then, "My Grate-

And then she says "sorry, I wasn't listening.  Would you start over?"

This is the last paragraph, my "friend" in crime.  Don't
forget it for
nothing,
ya hear?
