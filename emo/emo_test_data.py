    # the circulation. Whenever I find myself growing grim about the mouth;
    # whenever it is a damp, drizzly November in my soul; whenever I find
    # myself involuntarily pausing before coffin warehouses, and bringing up
    # the rear of every funeral I meet; and especially whenever my hypos get
    # such an upper hand of me, that it requires a strong moral principle to
    # prevent me from deliberately stepping into the street, and methodically
    # knocking people's hats off--then, I account it high time to get to sea
    # as soon as I can. This is my substitute for pistol and ball. With a
    # philosophical flourish Cato throws himself upon his sword; I quietly
    # take to the ship. There is nothing surprising in this. If they but knew
    # it, almost all men in their degree, some time or other, cherish very
    # nearly the same feelings towards the ocean with me?.""",
