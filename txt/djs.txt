2014.09.04 Thu	WAH 	Rest day.

2014.09.05 Fri	WAH	Accuracy Review with Stijn, lots of pretty graphs, including Michael’s 3D “Grand Canyon” of atrocious command-only WERs.  MetroRock bouldering.  Charlie and Morgan came for dinner.  TV: old episodes of Breaking Bad.

2014.09.06 Sat	Home

2014.09.07 Sun	Rumney	Nicolas and Teresa.  Sweet Polly Purebred, Underdog, Know Ethics, Peanut Man, Gunboat Diplomacy.  See http://mountainproject.com/u/sprax-lines//107620610?action=ticks&

2014.09.08 Mon	WAH.	Noonball at MIT.  Late because of reading news about the autopsy in Ferguson, 6 bullets, just sickening.  Played well.  Talked with Chris F after, who told me he didn’t sleep the night after we had lost it during basketball. (The pass to his head, etc.)
 2014.09.09 Tue	WAH.	Walked T to game camp at Knight Moves Café.  Work: finally found the incipience, if not yet the cause, of the wiggle.  Isabella video’d L pouring a bucket of ice water on her head and challenging Serena, Nyan, et al to do the same in the name of ALS research.  Picked up T, walked up Summit Hill to climb trees, including the horizontal limb near the bottom. Watched a skateboarder descending, ballsy.  Anna’s for dinner.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High got vetoed.  L watched 17 Again.  “Meh.”  Online spending spree continues with more climbing shoes and a “replacement” rope.  What about surfboard(s)?  Moved computer from Carey’s over-the-porch office back up to the attic.

2014.09.10 Wed	WAH	MR with DG.  He had to rest, but made it up a big bulbous blue 10a.  I carelessly fell off a backstep on 11b.  Then slacked and bouldered to closing time.  Started attic clean-up.

2014.09.11 Thu	WAH 	Rest day.  100 pull-ups, some abs.  Watched Idris Elba in Mandela: The Long Walk Home.  Cleaning up the attic.

2014.09.12 Fri	WAH	Noonball, then SUP on the Charles.  The autonomous robot boat was fully autonomous as I paddled by  First time I (knowingly) shared the water with an autonomous vehicle.  Charlie’s for Chinese food, chess, etc.  Too tired to go ice skating at 9 pm, or too balky at the $5 fee BU want’s to charge this year.  Rachel Z is now asking C to fix her up: Doesn’t want to see herself as only a single mom and widow(!).  It’s been 2 months since she stopped and waited in line for a latte at Starbucks while Seth drove to the Tobin Bridge and jumped off.

2014.09.13 Sat	Home	Liliana’s soccer game at Brookline Avenue Field.  Took the Kahuna Creations Bombora + Big Stick for everyone to try.  Even Sharmi got on it.  Then picked up DG and drove to Richard & Gabrielle Doucette’s house in Tamworth, NH, for a party.

2014.09.14 Sun	NH		Whitehorse with DG & Wally.  Hotter Than Hell, Inferno, Here Come the Jugs, Cosmic Amazement (fairly committing start), Ethereal Crack, Seventh Seal.

2014.09.15 Mon	WAH	Noonball at MIT, weight room.  Stiff, tired, and sore.  Hard to concentrate.  Patching together old journals into a chronology instead of finding fares to New Zealand.

2014.09.16 Tue	Kimball Farms	Work outing.  Pitch & Putt.  Ice cream, watching the volleyball.  Driving range with Steven, Joe.  Batting cage with Joev et al.  Bumper boats with Joev, Naveen, Brian, etc.  Skateboard to L’s soccer practice.  Library: pile of Tim Roth DVDs. Get T from Russian Math.  Dorado’s.  Still too tired.

2014.09.17 Wed	WAH	Van battery is empty.  Noonball at MIT, back grinding & painful when running, probably from Kimball Farms golf & batting practice. Until I can learn some non-harmful body mechanics, no more of that!  Weights after basketball: 40 partial pull-ups in one set.  Work: new WER gap.

2014.09.18 Thu	WAH 	Ice skating at BU, $5 per session during “Open Skate,” or maybe $55/season.  They’ll spend more collecting than they take in, but that’s BU.  Robert says they don’t publicize and don’t charge MWF.  Told me about his car battery foibles, $500 for a new battery for his Porsche 911 Turbo convertible, less than a year old.  Carey met with the new Lincoln School principal and Sarah Kidderman in the pergola.  Katie came over to talk about their new science podcast, which they officially pitch Monday.  I bought our tickets: BOSLAXNAN(Fiji)-AKL(NZ)NANLAXBOS.  The MetroRock, yoga, climb w/o partner.

2014.09.19 Fri	WAH	Noonball.  Jimmy Fund Benefit at Harvard: Evening with Champions, including Jeremy Abbott and Johnny Weir.

2014.09.20 21 	Gunks and NYC with Boris, Yvonne, Rani

2014.09.20 Sat	HomeGunks	Met Boris, Yvonne, & Rani at Mountain Deli and went climbing: Mother’s Day Party, MF (linked both pitches), Interstice, Men At Arms.  Left car in Gunks lot, drove into NYC to stay with them in their new penthouse.

2014.09.21 Sun	NYCGunksHome	Late start, climbed Venre de Boeuf, Vader, Double Crack.  Bought coffee + guarana in a can for the drive, but didn’t open it.  Too wired.  Cleaned up, watched Breaking Bad S3E13, bed at 3 AM.

2014.09.23 Tue	WAH	Still too sore to want to ice skate at BU.  Fourth attempt to charge Odyssey battery… failed.  Work: script to put test results in canonical format for comparison.

2014.09.25 Thu	WAH, Rosh Hashana school holiday.  Took kids to BU for ice skating.  They carded me but did not ask for the $15.  Fell again, toe pick.  Still sore from Ventre de Beouf!

2014.09.27 Sat	Cannon with Nicolas Preitner.  VMC Direct Direct, spectacular and stout.  N led the hard pitches.  I hung on P2 to clean stuck nuts, fell on the 11ish slap starting P5, and slip on wet shoe at the Cow’s Mouth.  Mossy loose top out, probably 200 feet of “optional” climbing from not escaping right.

2014.09.28 Sun	Home.	Tully at an athletic training session in Needham; he didn’t like it.  L: Tennis at Amory.  Carey meeting Allison before her hip-replacement surgery.  Clean-up, maybe install more hang boards and holds.

2016.10.02 Looking at jrnl config code.
Maybe adding more characters acceptible in tags.
Or Not.  But what about lines
broken for no apparent reason?

Or, more importantly, a separate paragraph with no date?  
This should be parsed as belonging to the most same date as the previous
paragraph.
