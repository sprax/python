The Script
----------
The subs_cipher.py script contains a class (SubCipher) and a main-function
driver that uses this class to infer and reverse a simple substituion
cipher.  Given a small sample of enciphered English text and a large corpus
of more or less similar English text, it derives the forward cipher key and
decrypts the sample text, writing each to separate files.
